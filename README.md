# cwhats
See what happens with simple c code.

# Explanation
Clearly, c also stands for "see" and these are mainly snippets
which show very simple but often, powerful effects

# Contents

## gorounda.c
The name is a mnemonic for "Go around array" and it's used for comparing the
each element of an array with the rest, one by one, in circular fashion.

## pwco.c
Coded much later, but seems to be similar to the above. PairWise Comparison Operations

## mirutma.c
Mnemonic MIR Upper Triangular MAtrix
matrix transformation: principally mirroring triangle matrices.

## aa.c
This was the result of a game presented by Nuritas when looking for bioinformaticians.
a peptide sequence with heterogeneous quantities of the different AA's (as is normal)
must be converted to a sequence with equally represented AA's, and the smallest subsequence
with those change must be calculated. Because it's a single subsequence. Luckily the length of the sequence
is an integer multiple of the number of the AA's used which happens to be the full complement of 20.

There was a number of function here that I have already coded elsewhere ... and I did try to looks for them
but they didn't come up (especialy the codon code from Uppsala), and it was easier to code from zero.
